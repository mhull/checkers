# Checkers

This was an attempt at creating a checkers game using AngularJS, back when Angular 1 was still a relevant thing
to be learning. You can [play yourself in checkers](https://mhull.github.io/checkers) and it is functional to a high degree, but at some point I moved
onto other things and never finished so there is no real end game. Still overall, this was a great learning experience
for me.
